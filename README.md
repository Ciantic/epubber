## Notes

-   OPF `<guide />` along with `<reference />` is deprecated in favor of `epub:type` attributes. However I've noticed many epub files contain guide section for backwards compatibility.
-   `epub:type` is defined in [EPUB Content Documents 3.2](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-epub-type-attribute) but `epub:type` values are available in [EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary](https://idpf.github.io/epub-vocabs/structure/).
